# FiltDeTox: A Tool to Enhance and Filter Animal Toxins Identification from RNAseq Analyses

## Tool Description

**FiltDeTox** is an advanced bioinformatics pipeline designed to enhance the identification and classification of toxin-related sequences from RNAseq data. The tool integrates outputs from **TransDecoder**, **DeTox**, **BLASTp** (e.g., against UniRef90), and **Pfam domain annotations** to provide a streamlined and precise method for identifying animal toxins.

The pipeline uses a toxin keyword classification system, applying filters to minimize false positives and refine the dataset into high-confidence toxin candidates. This helps researchers focus on the most relevant sequences while discarding likely non-toxins. The pipeline is modular, meaning each component can be run independently or as part of the complete workflow.

## Modules Overview

### 1. TransDeTox
This module merges the outputs from TransDecoder BLASTp and DeTox, identifying candidate toxin sequences by matching sequence identifiers. By combining BLASTp annotations and DeTox predictions, it provides a refined dataset of sequences with potential toxin-related properties. It uses multiprocessing for efficient handling of large datasets and generates a combined output of BLASTp and DeTox data.

### 2. ToxinKeyMatch
This module classifies sequences based on toxin-related Pfam domains and curated toxin-related keywords. It applies keyword matching and domain filtering based on curated lists of metazoan toxins and venom proteins (filtered from UniProt), allowing for more precise identification of potential toxin sequences.

### 3. FiltDeTox
The final module further refines the dataset by applying an additional filtering step based on binary classifications generated in previous modules. It retains only high-confidence toxin candidates, eliminating sequences classified as non-toxins or unlikely toxins based on ToxinKeyMatch and DeTox flags.

## Execution and Customization

- **Independent Module Execution:**
  Each module can be executed independently, allowing users to optimize specific stages of the workflow or customize individual parts to fit their needs.
  
- **Pipeline Automation:**
  A shell script (`FiltDeTox.sh`) can automate the entire process, executing all modules in sequence and generating the final output.
  
- **Seamless Updates:**
  FiltDeTox allows continuous improvement with easy updates to toxin-related keywords, Pfam domains, and filtering criteria.

## Future Improvements

FiltDeTox is designed for continuous improvement, with Modules 2 (ToxinKeyMatch) and Module 3 (FiltDeTox) being adaptable. Users can update the keyword lists, Pfam domains, and filtering logic as new toxin-related data becomes available, making the tool more precise and versatile over time.

`bash`
`pip install pandas`

## R-based Scripts (ToxRecov.R):
To run the FiltDeTox module using R, ensure **R** or **RStudio** is installed. Install the necessary R packages with the following commands:

```
# Install packages from CRAN
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("tidyr")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("stringdist")
install.packages("ape")
install.packages("cowplot")
install.packages("RcolorBrewer")

BiocManager::install("ggtree")

```
# Alternatively, install ggtree using devtools (optional):
```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("YuLab-SMU/ggtree")
```

Ensure the working directory is set correctly before running any of the modules, particularly for FiltDeTox:

`R`
`setwd("/path/to/FiltDeTox/")`

This ensures that the R script saves the output files in the correct directory.
